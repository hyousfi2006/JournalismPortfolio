                                    As Editor-in-Chief I have a lot of experience leading others, as well as teaching the art of journalism to younger students. Last year and this year I have been a part of the Introduction to Journalism class assisting my advisor as a teacher to the freshman and sophomore reporters who were looking to learn something new. With this role I learned a lot about patience, leadership, and working will with others. Below are some links to articles written by students who were guided/advised by me.

                                    As a Muslim student who only eats halal meats, essentially meaning that I follow vegetarian restrictions in the cafeteria, this story felt like something that I had to write. I feel as though this article could have been written a bit better though, I still think it does a good job of representing the voices of underrepresented students who want to be heard better by City Officials.

                                    Many students in Malden do not have places to go to after school in which they feel comfortable or safe. Many unfortunately do not have access to warm food and a sense of security. When I began going to the teen center and noticed that so many younger students didn’t know about this place I made it my mission to write a piece to convey to students at my school just how amazing a resource this place could be if used properly. This article was one of my most celebrated as it was shouted out during a City Council meeting by the Mayor as well as the founder of the MTEC.

                                    As a school with an incredibly diverse student body it is important that we as journalists report about our student organization that supports students of different backgrounds. I feel as though I did a great job writing this article and explaining how important it is to the students at MHS. I would have done a better job getting more opinions from students on how the club has supported them.

                                    Recently I decided to write a sports captain profile honoring our school’s senior swim captain who helped lead the team to the GBL Title. In this article, I feel as though I was able to capture Joyce’s essence as well as create a permanent record of her contributions to MHS as a captain, I feel as though this article shows a great improvement from the articles that I have written over the past few years.

                                    At this point in my journalism career, I found sports to be something quite difficult for me to cover, I struggled to properly convey the story and truly encapsulate the player’s passion. However, I decided to take on this project to challenge myself. Though this article was one of my first, I feel that I did a great job and that it helps to showcase a world of improvement to my second Boys Soccer article almost a year later.

                                    As a writer over the years one of the things that I have found to be fun to write about is soccer. I find it exciting to write about players who have a high level of passion for such a globally loved sport. When writing this article I found it exciting to interview a variety of different students from different backgrounds and loved having the chance to convey the team's story, though it may not have been a success for them that season. The photos in this article are also some of my best, as I managed to capture their emotions and the true heat of the game.

                                    As a leader in my journalism team it has become a regular occurrence for me to copy-edit many articles. I reread articles a number of times, suggesting mechanical and stylistic fixes, as well as showcasing possible skill improvements to allow our writers to improve while also feeling supported by myself and the other leaders. Over the years I have seen a great improvement in the skills of our younger writers, a number of which I took front reign in teaching.

                                    Alongside my skills as an editor I have also learned many useful publishing skills, and have become a self proclaimed master of my school’s site on WordPress, I am able to publish a variety of different content including photos, articles, videos, podcasts and more. Additionally my skills in HTML have added to my ability to publish creatively on WordPress.
